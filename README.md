# URL-screenshot
This Script captures the Screenshot of a webpage from its URL.
You can also choose to **download** it.

It uses the **page2images API** to fetch the Screenshot.

For this to work you will need to enter your **page2images API-key**. 
If you dont have one, you can get it [here](http://www.page2images.com/sign_up) for free.

This is just a basic version that captures **Desktop-compatible** Screenshots.
